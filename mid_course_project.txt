Introduction
Recently I wanted to test and re-up my SQL capabilities. I spent some time searching available SQL courses and decided to take Nikolai Shuster's "15 Days of SQL: The Complete SQL Masterclass 2023" available on Udemy.
I enrolled because the subject matter was pertinent, the format was effective, and the instructor and course had incredible reviews.
What follows is a "Mid term" of sorts. The course is loaded with practical examples and 1/2 through the course Nikolai presented a project / exam for students to assess their SQL capabilities. I got 14/14 (Senior Data Analyst).

* The questions and "greencycles" data were graciously provided by Nikolai as a part of the Udemy course.
* The solutions that follow are my own.
